Notes:
This is my first foray into NodeJs, GraphQL and React. I wanted to see how far I could get. 
I was able to complete most of the project with the following exceptions.
- GraphQL conversion. I searched until the cows came home but could not find working examples to help
me learn this process. Therefore I was not able to parse out the actual homeland for the users
- Pagination - I could not yet figure out how to get pagination working on the json data. I know I need to 
add use the **next** and **previous** attributes on the returned data but I could not figure out how to
  implement this feature un time.
  
**Summary**
I am highly confident that with a tiny bit of assistance I could completely implement this challenge.
All of my AngularJS, Backbone, JQuery, Vanilla javascript knowledge has been learned on the job and
would definitley be able to perform functions like this in no time.

I apologize that I could not fully complete it.
